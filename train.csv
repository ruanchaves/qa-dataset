EXEO Group is mainly engaged in the engineering solution business and the system solution business.

According to KYEC's parent company financial report for 2022, the net sales was NT$27.619 billion, which would be TWD 27,619,000 thousands. Additionally, another source indicates King Yuan Electronics had NT$36.78 billion in annual revenue in FY 2022, which would be TWD 36,780,000 thousands. The discrepancy may be due to different reporting standards (parent company only versus consolidated results including subsidiaries).

King Yuan Electronics provides multiple services including:
- Wafer probing/testing services
- Final product testing services  
- Burn-in testing
- Assembly services
- Other semiconductor backend services

While the company is described as the second-largest firm in terms of testing revenue and the largest professional pure-play testing company worldwide, the publicly available financial reports and investor materials I found do not break down revenue specifically by service type (wafer test versus final test versus other services).

According to Kewpie's Summary of Consolidated Financial Statements for fiscal year 2023, the impact of egg price increases was negative 5.2 billion yen for the full year plan. This was part of a larger negative impact from raw material price increases totaling 18.8 billion yen.

For the first half of fiscal 2023, the egg price impact was negative 2.6 billion yen. The document indicates these impacts are included in the change in gross profit margin, though the specific gross profit margin impact is not separately quantified.

The company's Annual Report 2023 notes they were ""influenced by factors such as high international grain and energy prices as well as the spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza virus."" The avian influenza outbreak significantly affected egg prices in Japan during this period.

3. **Overall gross profit impact**: Kewpie's gross profit decreased from [124.2 billion yen](https://daloopa.com/src/130765671) in FY2022 to [122.3 billion yen](https://daloopa.com/src/130765672) in FY2023, with egg prices being a primary driver of this decline.

As a major mayonnaise manufacturer where eggs are a critical raw material, Kewpie was particularly vulnerable to the sharp rise in Japanese egg market prices during this period.

Skylark Holdings Co., Ltd., a major operator of family restaurants in Japan, reported a total capital expenditure of **¥18,726 million** for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2023. This figure is detailed in the company's consolidated financial statements.

The capital expenditure is a key indicator of a company's investment in its future growth and is primarily allocated towards the opening of new restaurants, refurbishment of existing locations, and investment in information technology and other infrastructure to enhance operational efficiency and customer experience.

Within the company's Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for fiscal year 2023, the capital expenditure is specifically listed under ""Cash flows from investing activities."" A closer look at the detailed financial statements reveals that the line item ""Purchase of property, plant and equipment"" accounts for this reported amount.

For the same fiscal year, Skylark Holdings reported ""Net cash used in investing activities"" of ¥14,861 million. This net figure is calculated after accounting for proceeds from the sale of assets and other investing inflows and outflows, and therefore differs from the gross capital expenditure.

In the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 31, 2024 (Q4 2023), Rakus Co., Ltd. reported robust sales for its Cloud Business, a key indicator of its recurring revenue strength. The company's financial disclosures indicate that the Cloud Business segment generated net sales of **9,051 million JPY** for the quarter.

While Rakus Co., Ltd. does not explicitly report a specific metric for Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) in its publicly available financial statements, the net sales from its Cloud Business are largely comprised of recurring, subscription-based revenue. Therefore, the performance of this segment is a primary indicator of the company's ARR trajectory.

To estimate an annualized figure based on the fourth-quarter performance, the Cloud Business net sales of 9,051 million JPY would suggest an annualized run rate of approximately **36,204 million JPY**. This calculation provides a strong indication of the company's forward-looking recurring revenue from its cloud-based services.

Precise, publicly available data for TS Tech's automotive seats revenue specifically in China for the third quarter of 2022 is not available in the company's financial disclosures. However, an estimation can be made based on their annual financial reporting.

For the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, TS Tech reported a total revenue of **117,800 million JPY** from its operations in China. The company's primary business is the manufacturing of automotive seats, which constitutes the vast majority of its sales.

To arrive at a quarterly estimate, one can assume an even distribution of revenue throughout the fiscal year. This would place the estimated total revenue for China in the third quarter of 2022 (October 1 to December 31, 2022) at approximately **29,450 million JPY**.

While a specific revenue percentage for the automotive seat segment in China for that period is not detailed, looking at the company's overall business structure for the following fiscal year (ending March 31, 2024), the seat business accounted for 84.9% of total revenue. Applying this percentage as a proxy, the estimated automotive seats revenue in China for Q3 2022 would be in the range of **25,000 million JPY**.

Shimamura Co., Ltd. reported an operating profit of ¥16,386 million for the third quarter of the fiscal year 2023, which corresponds to the three-month period ending November 20, 2023.

The Japanese fashion retail giant's financial disclosures reveal that the cumulative operating profit for the nine months leading up to November 20, 2023, stood at ¥46,559 million. To determine the operating profit for the third quarter specifically, the cumulative operating profit from the preceding six-month period, which ended on August 20, 2023, was subtracted. The operating profit for the first six months of the fiscal year was ¥30,173 million.

The calculation is as follows:
* Cumulative Operating Profit for Nine Months (ending Nov 20, 2023): ¥46,559 million
* Cumulative Operating Profit for Six Months (ending Aug 20, 2023): ¥30,173 million

In 2022, the company's revenue surpassed the R$1 billion mark, with growing rent revenue combined with parking results contributing to 25.6% and 19.1% expansions of net revenue versus 2021 and 2019, respectively.

The company achieved a record occupancy rate of 97.4% in Q4 2022, the highest since the creation of Aliansce Sonae.

The press releases mention that the full version of their Q4 2022 earnings report was available at their investor relations website (https://ri.alianscesonae.com.br/en), which would likely contain the NOI figure. However, the company has since merged with brMalls to create a new entity called ALLOS, which may have affected the availability of historical financial reports on their website.

The company reported non-GAAP operating expenses of $220.6 million for the full fiscal year.

In addition to the full-year results, the company also provided guidance for the first quarter of fiscal year 2026. For that quarter, Ambarella projected non-GAAP operating expenses to be in the range of $50.0 million to $53.0 million.

### Understanding the Metrics

It appears there may be some confusion in the query, as ""adjusted EBITDA less cash conversion ratio"" is not a standard financial metric. It's not possible to subtract a percentage from a monetary value in a meaningful way. However, both **adjusted EBITDA** and the **cash conversion ratio** are key performance indicators for the company, and they are provided below for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2022.

* **Adjusted EBITDA:** This metric represents the company's earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, adjusted for certain non-recurring items. For 2022, this figure was **$694 million**.
* **Cash Conversion Ratio:** This ratio measures how efficiently a company converts its profit into cash. It is typically calculated by dividing the adjusted free cash flow by the adjusted EBITDA.

According to the Q4 2023 earnings call transcript, the Renewable Energy Group's full year 2023 operating profit was $371.8 million, which represented a 9% decrease year over year.

Based on this information, if the 2023 figure of $371.8 million represents a 9% decrease from 2022, we can calculate that the renewable energy group's divisional operating profit for fiscal year 2022 was approximately **$408.6 million USD**.

This calculation comes from: $371.8 million ÷ 0.91 = $408.6 million (since 2023 represented 91% of the 2022 figure after a 9% decline).

The decrease from 2022 to 2023 was primarily driven by an expected drop in HLBV (Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value) income from certain 2012 vintage assets reaching end of PTC (Production Tax Credit) eligibility and unfavorable weather across Canadian and U.S. wind facilities.",408600000,4.0,Calculated incorrectly by working backwards from 2023 data instead of using actual 2022 figure,1,2,4,Segment Performance,Easy,USD,https://claude.ai/share/06a3aeda-f732-491e-9456-ba24e1208a09,False

However, they do not appear to provide a detailed breakdown that specifically identifies R&D expenses separately from other operating costs such as sales, marketing, and general administrative expenses.

   - Net income of $15M in 2023
   - Net income dropped 14% year over year to $125,736,161 (this appears to be for eToro UK specifically)

2. **Interest income information (but for 2024, not 2023):**
   - Interest income on customer deposits grew to $50 million in Q4 2024 (20% of total revenue)
   - 20% from net interest as a revenue stream in their diversified business model

3. **Revenue components:** eToro reports that Net Interest Contribution represents Net interest contribution from users plus Other interest income plus the net contributions of staking activity, less Margin interest expense

The specific breakdown of net interest income from users for fiscal year 2023 doesn't appear to be separately disclosed in eToro's publicly available financial documents. This metric may be:
- Included within broader revenue categories in their financial statements
- Available only in detailed SEC filings that aren't fully accessible
- Not separately reported for that specific year

For the most accurate and detailed information about this specific metric, you may need to:
1. Access eToro's complete SEC F-1 filing directly
2. Review their full 2023 annual report if available
3. Contact eToro's investor relations department directly",,5.0,Could not find the information and declined to answer,1,1,3,Income Statement,Easy,USD,https://claude.ai/share/c3939b3e-c99a-476d-9447-2e95c1d8d1b8,False

What I was able to find about Cienega's 2022 performance:

1. **Cash cost per gold ounce**: The cash cost per gold ounce at Cienega increased from -US$523.1 in 2021 to US$518.5 in 2022, primarily due to higher cost per tonne, lower gold ore grade, and higher treatment and refining charges.

2. **AISC increase**: The US$1,355.0 per ounce increase in all-in sustaining cost was primarily driven by the higher cash cost and a higher sustaining capex per ounce of gold.

The documents indicate that Cienega's AISC increased by $1,355 per ounce from 2021 to 2022, but don't provide the actual 2022 AISC figure. To get the exact 2022 AISC for Cienega, you would need to either:
- Find the 2021 AISC baseline and add $1,355 to it
- Access Fresnillo's detailed 2022 annual report or investor presentations which might contain a breakdown table with specific AISC figures for each mine

The significant increase in AISC reflects the challenging operating environment Fresnillo faced in 2022, including cost inflation, labor challenges following Mexican labor reforms, and operational difficulties at the mine.",,5.0,Could not find the exact AISC figure despite providing context,1,2,3,Operational Costs,Medium,USD,https://claude.ai/share/09d4e070-964f-4658-aa3e-d613a5c1fcfb,False

Here's what I can tell you about Jefferson Capital:

Jefferson Capital (JCAP) is a debt collection and consumer finance company that completed its IPO in June 2025. The company purchases charged-off consumer receivables at deep discounts and collects on these debts.

The available financial data shows:

- Q2 2025: Collections were $255.7 million (up 85% year-over-year)
- 2024: Annual revenue was $433.76M with 29.08% growth
- The company reported that its growth was ""primarily driven by deployments made in 2023 and 2024""

The company tracks ""collections"" as a key performance metric, which represents the actual cash collected from the debt portfolios they purchase. However, the specific total collections figure for fiscal year 2023 is not available in the public SEC filings and financial reports I was able to access. The company's S-1 registration statement and subsequent filings focus primarily on 2024 and 2025 financial data.

If you need this specific 2023 figure, you might need to contact Jefferson Capital's investor relations directly or review their complete S-1 filing, which may contain more detailed historical financial information.

While I found numerous quarterly earnings reports and press releases for fiscal 2023 that mention amortization in various contexts (such as ""timing of programming amortization"" affecting segment profits), none of the documents I accessed contained the specific annual total amortization figure you're looking for.

This information would typically be found in:
- The Statement of Cash Flows in Lionsgate's 10-K annual report for fiscal 2023
- The notes to the financial statements

To obtain this specific figure, I recommend:
1. Accessing Lionsgate's complete 10-K filing for fiscal year 2023 directly from the SEC EDGAR database
2. Looking at the Statement of Cash Flows, where ""Amortization of films and television programs"" is typically listed as a line item under operating activities
3. Checking the financial statement notes for detailed breakdowns of content amortization

As of the fourth quarter of 2023, Plains GP Holdings, through its operating entity Plains All American Pipeline, did not publicly disclose the specific Natural Gas Liquids (NGL) storage capacity for its individual Fort Saskatchewan facility. However, this facility is a key component of the company's broader Canadian NGL operations, which had a total storage capacity of approximately **22 to 23 million barrels**.

Plains All American's presence in Fort Saskatchewan is multifaceted. The company operates its own assets in the area, a significant hub for NGL processing and storage in Western Canada. The situation is nuanced by a transaction in February 2023, where Plains sold its 21% ownership interest in the Keyera Fort Saskatchewan (KFS) facility to Keyera Corp. Despite this sale, Plains maintained access to storage and fractionation capacity at the KFS facility through a multi-year leaseback agreement.

Therefore, while a precise figure for the Plains-owned and operated storage at Fort Saskatchewan is not available in public financial disclosures, it is an integral part of their substantial Canadian NGL storage infrastructure. It is important to note that in a major strategic shift announced in mid-2025, Keyera Corp. entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of Plains All American's Canadian NGL assets.

This figure represents the total value of contracted work for which revenue has not yet been recognized.

The company's backlog at the close of 2022 was reported at a record $5.5 billion. The difference between the backlog and the remaining performance obligations is primarily attributed to the accounting treatment of Master Service Agreements (MSAs). While the full value of MSAs is included in the backlog, only the portion with firm purchase orders or other commitments is typically recognized as part of the remaining performance obligations under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).

(NYSE: QTWO), a leading provider of digital transformation solutions for the financial services industry, announced an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 20.6% for the fourth quarter of 2024. This figure was a key highlight in the company's financial results for the quarter and full year ending December 31, 2024.

To find this information, you would need to look at State Street's 2023 Annual Report (Form 10-K) which was filed with the SEC in February 2024. The total interest expense would be listed in their Consolidated Statement of Income. This document is available on:

1. State Street's investor relations website at investors.statestreet.com under ""Filings and Reports""
